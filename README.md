# Terraform Labs

Workshops for demonstrating the use of Terraform to provision resources in AWS.

## Getting started

### Installing Terraform

Follow the instructions here to install Terraform: https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install

### Setting up AWS Credentials

Create a `.env` file (based on `.env.sample`), and run `source .env` so that the environment variables are loaded. You will need programmatic access to your AWS account (with EC2, S3 and DynamoDB permissions).
