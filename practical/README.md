# Practical Lab

Scenario-based Terraform Practice Lab exercises.

## Scenario

You are recently hired as a DevOps engineer in Acme Pte Ltd. At the moment, Acme is trying to prototype a simple mobile app with simple backend for persistence. After evaluation, they decided to use Parse Server (https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/) as the backend. Parse Server is a simple express server that provides APIs to integrate with MongoDB. It is simple to set up with Docker.
